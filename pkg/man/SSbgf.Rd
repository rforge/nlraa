\title{
selfStart for the beta growth function
}
\description{
Implements some self starting rules for the beta growth function as
desribed by Yin et. al (2003). This is equation 2.5 in the paper
referenced below (Archontoulis and Miguez).
}
\usage{
SSbgf(time, w.max, t.e, t.m)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{time}{
    a numeric vector of values at which to evaluate the model. This is
    typically expressed in some measure of time.
    
  }
  \item{w.max}{ A numeric parameter representing the maximum weight (or
    biomass).  }

  \item{t.e}{ A numeric parameter representing the time at
    which maximum weight is attained (w.max).  }

  \item{t.m}{ A numeric
parameter representing the time at which the inflection point of the
curve is attained. The maximum growth rate ocurrs at this time.  }

}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~

\value{
returns a numeric vector of the same length as the input
%%  ~Describe the value returned
